To start the phase, I decided to run a series of workshops for the client to take us through some of their main digital propositions where we could discuss pain points and frustrations and delve a bit deeper into the history of why those pain points exist. The objective is to essential reverse the requirements gathering process so we understand the current state rather than the future state./n/nAs we progressed through the workshops I was able to begin to understand certain themes which we could begin to build a strategy around. So the next workshop was to map what we had discovered back to what I would now call Strategical Pillars./n/nThese Strategical Pillars became:</h2>
