I"M<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The client, St. James’s Place (SJP), is a financial services organisation with a network of 3,000+ financial advisers (partners) in the UK and Asia, each with a centrally managed website. Our mission was to migrate the existing partner network from the incumbent agency to a new tech ecosystem.</p>

<p>There were many reasons the client wished to move away from their incumbent agency, including but not limited to four key pain points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cost - ~£300k per month to manage and maintain with the incumbent</li>
  <li>Efficiency - Existing stack was old and inefficient meaning change was cumbersome, expensive, and the technical debt was mountainous</li>
  <li>Compliance Risk - Given the cost and inefficiency of the existing stack the risk of non-compliance with FCA regulations was a growing concern, and some minor breaches had the client nervous</li>
  <li>Adaptivity - The aforementioned challenges created an inert inability for SJP to respond and adapt to market changes, user needs and service requirements of partners.</li>
</ul>
