I"ð<p>Over the last 2 years (2020 to 2022) I have been engaged with the European division on Nikon (Nikon B.V.) on an extensive Digital Transformation project. As an avid photography enthusiast this was such a great opportunity to work on a product from an industry and brand I love.</p>

<p>Like most Digital Transformation projects, the scope with Nikon B.V. is huge, from E-Commerce to Automated Marketing and everything in-between. There is no aspect of the B.V. ecosystem I didnâ€™t touch.</p>
