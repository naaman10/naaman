<p>My role during the strategy phase was to work with Nikon to understand exactly what their current state of play is, to really get to grips with their landscape.</p>

<p>To start the phase, I decided to run a series of workshops for the client to take us through some of their main digital propositions where we could discuss pain points and frustrations and delve a bit deeper in to the history of why those pain point exist. The objective is to essential reverse the requirements gathering process so we understand current state rather than future state.</p>

<p>As we progressed through the workshops I was able to begin to understand certain themes which we could begin to build a strategy around. So the next workshop was to map what we had discovered back to what I would now call Strategical Pillars.</p>

<p>These Strategical Pillars became:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cost Saving</li>
  <li>Analytics &amp; Data Quality</li>
  <li>User Experience</li>
  <li>Centralisation</li>
  <li>Platform Security &amp; GDPR</li>
  <li>Revenue Opportunities</li>
</ul>
