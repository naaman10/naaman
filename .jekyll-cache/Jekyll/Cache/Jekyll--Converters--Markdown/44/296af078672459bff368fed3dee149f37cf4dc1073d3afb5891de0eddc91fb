I"Ö<p>This session allowed us to do a few things, firstly, we were able to validate with the client the Strategical Pillars to make sure weâ€™re all aligned on the particular areas of focus.</p>

<p>Secondly, weâ€™re able to map individual pain points and requirements to pillars to give context to certain requirements. Finally, it allows us to get to grips with the objectives for the following projects and to be able to begin to understand the scope of work ahead.</p>
