<p>Once we passed the GDS Alpha Assessment, we were able to begin an Agile define/design and development phase of the project. My role within this phase of work was to define the technical requirements needed to delivery on the prototype. It was my responsibility to fully understand the needs of the users admin portal, the law and capabilities of the external APIs we would need to integrate with in order to define how the portal would need to work. I worked with our internal developers to define our own APIs, making sure that strict user roles and permissions where in place in order that, at all times, our service adhered to the law.</p>
