<p>My role straight from Discovery was to understand the requirements through workshops and working closely with the client to find the right method of handling, maintaining and future-proofing how the client handles their data that not only met the combined ongoing needs of the client and user, needs of the partner network and ensured FCA regulatory requirements.</p>

<p>The solution I created was a secure suite of admin functions which allowed the client to manage partner data, site data and publishing capabilities. The suite was to complement the CMS via custom APIâ€™s so that the eventual migration to Salesforce could be as smooth as possible. I needed to find and utilise an â€˜Out Of The Boxâ€™ service to be able to improve our time to live but also aligned with the existing skills within the project team so that those â€˜Out Of The Boxâ€™ services could be easily integrated and extended without a steep learning curve or introducing a skills gap. For this, I worked with the development team to select <a href="https://marmelab.com/react-admin/Readme.html" target="_blank">REACT Admin</a>.</p>

<p>The next stage for myself was to design and define a solution that allowed us to firstly migrate the existing data and, secondly, allowed the client to manage data while maintaining regulatory compliance. Additionally, I needed to adjust our workflow and processes to account for this additional workload alongside the definition and build of the CMS.</p>
