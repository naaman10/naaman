<p>During Discovery, my role was to work closely with our stakeholders to plan and uncover exactly what would be needed and begin designing the full end to end service, and begin to define requirements which would enable design teams to start building and testing prototypes. Our ultimate goal of Discovery was to have a Service Design and Prototype pass the GDS (Government Digital Services) Alpha Assessment.</p>

<p>Discovery included many internal and external workshops with stakeholders, design and development teams, other government departments, integration partners. Hereâ€™s some of the people we worked closely with during Discovery:</p>
