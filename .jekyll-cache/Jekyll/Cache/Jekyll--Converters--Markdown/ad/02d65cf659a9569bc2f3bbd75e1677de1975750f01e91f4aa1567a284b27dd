<p>My first interaction with Nikon B.V. started with running a strategy phase rather than a typical Discovery Phase. The idea is that Nikon knew they needed change but needed our help in first understanding what’s gone wrong and what needs to be done before we can look at any form of solution.</p>

<p>To set the scene even more, Nikon’s market position over the previous 20 years had been slipping. During the early 2000s, Nikon was flying high dominating the marketplace with enthusiast and pro ranges and also with the compact camera ranges perfect for the general consumer. So profit was high and with it was the autonomy of each market within Europe, markets could effectively do what they wanted, creating marketing sites and campaigns at will. Then, along came the iPhone and later other smartphones, and with every iteration, the built-in cameras on smartphones, companion software and the rise and easily integrated social media platform, the compact camera slowly died out. To add to this, Nikon were undoubtedly slow to the market with the release of new camera tech, Mirrorless. Sony broke the new market first, followed by Canon but Nikon didn’t make it to market with Mirrorless for a few years after, by which point they were playing catch-up and have arguably been doing so since. An obvious problem, therefore, began to grow, with the loss of a key segment in compact cameras and their lateness to the Mirrorless market, Nikon’s revenue and market share started to diminish yet their tech stack was unable to change with it. The result of markets being able to create and spend what they want over the last 20 years had left Nikon B.V.’s tech stack fragmented, decentralised and ultimately haemorrhaging money. This is where I come in…</p>
