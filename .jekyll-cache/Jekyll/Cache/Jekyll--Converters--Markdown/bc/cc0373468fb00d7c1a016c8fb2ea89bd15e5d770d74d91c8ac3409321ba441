<p>Once we passed the GDS Alpha Assessment, we were able to begin an Agile define/design and development phase of the project. My role within this phase of work was to define the technical requirements needed to delivery on the prototype. It was my responsibility to fully understand the needs of the users admin portal, the law and capabilities of the external APIs we would need to integrate with in order to define how the portal would need to work. I worked with our internal developers to define our own APIs, making sure that strict user roles and permissions where in place in order that, at all times, our service adhered to the law. This at times was challenging as, during Discovery and Definition, the legistlation would frequently change as it was being defined and reviewed. Agile development really help us to quickly adapt and change as new legal requirements came to us.</p>

<p>In addition to API definition, I also defined the front-end and data and anlytics requirements. Working with a team of UX/UI designers and Front-End developers, we created and easy to use experience for Electoral Registry Officers to be able to manage and process applications for Voter ID. Analytics is a vital part of allowing the goverment to understand service efficacy and cost, I was tasked with defining a KPI framework and, due to the sensitive nature of the data, a custom API to send events and metrics to the governments internal digital reporting service.</p>

<p>During the Define &amp; Build phase it was vital to have a clear roadmap to articulate progress to stakeholders and provide development with an understanding of priorities and context. Working closely with project management and stakeholders. I decided the best option was to maintain roadmap and product backlog directly in Jira as it was the best way to give a consistently â€˜as isâ€™ view of the project, especially vital with multiple stakeholders and frequently changing legislative requirements.</p>
