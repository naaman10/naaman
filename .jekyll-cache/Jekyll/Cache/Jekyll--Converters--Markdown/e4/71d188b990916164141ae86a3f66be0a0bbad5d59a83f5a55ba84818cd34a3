I"e<p>Our hotel was a 5-minute walk from the Eiffel Tower, so naturally, it’s the first place we headed to after checking in. I was taken aback at the size and spectacle of the tower, it’s something that you just don’t have the perspective of until stood in front of it. So my first challenge was to try to capture the volume and scale of the tower.</p>
