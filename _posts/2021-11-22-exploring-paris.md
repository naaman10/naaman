  text: "For as long as I can remember Paris has been one of the cities consistently
    at the top of my bucket list. It's the city of love, steeped in history, it's
    world-renowned for food and drink, fashion and culture. Why not? \n\nMid 2021
    came and, after over a year or so of lockdown and restrictions, frustration set
    in. I'm not usually fussy about not being able to go on holidays etc. as usually
    I at least have the option to do day trips or travel with work. When that option
    is taken away, that frustration grows so, when the opportunity arose to take my
    partner away for her birthday, I took it."

  text: 'Our hotel was a 5-minute walk from the Eiffel Tower, so naturally, it''s
    the first place we headed to after checking in. I was taken aback at the size
    and spectacle of the tower, it''s something that you just don''t have the perspective
    of until stood in front of it. So my first challenge was to try to capture the
    volume and scale of the tower. '

    what perspective you decide to take a shot from its scale seems to get lost. '
