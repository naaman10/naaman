  text: "## Introduction\n\nNikon, incase you haven't heard of them, are an imaging
    product company, specialising in the manufacture and development of consumer photography
    products like cameras and lenses, sport optics like binoculars and microscopy
    products. \n\nThey're one of the three biggest Imaging specialists in the world,
    that being Nikon, Sony and Canon. Nikon have been one of the biggest for the best
    part of the last 100 years since their founding in 1917. "

  text: "Over the last 2 years (2020 to 2022) I have been engaged with the European
    division on Nikon (Nikon B.V.) on an extensive Digital Transformation project.
    As an avid photography enthusiast this was such a great opportunity to work on
    a product from an industry and brand I love. \n\nLike most Digital Transformation
    projects, the scope with Nikon B.V. is huge, from E-Commerce to Automated Marketing
    and everything in-between. There is no aspect of the B.V. ecosystem I didn't touch."

  text: "## Project Background\n\nMy first interaction with Nikon B.V. started with
    running a strategy phase rather than a typical Discovery Phase. The idea being
    that Nikon knew they needed change but needed our help in first understanding
    what's gone wrong and needs to be done before we can look at any form of solution.\n\nTo
    set the scene even more, Nikon's market position over the previous 20 years had
    been slipping. During the early 2000's, Nikon were flying high dominating the
    market place with enthusiast and pro ranges and also with the compact cameras
    ranges perfect for the general consumer. So profit was high and with it was the
    autonomy of each market within Europe, markets could effectively do what they
    wanted, creating marketing sites and campaigns at will.\n\nThen, along came the
    iPhone and later other smartphones, and with every iteration, the built in cameras
    on smartphones, companion software and the rise and easily integrated social media
    platform, the compact camera slowly died out.\n\nTo add to this, Nikon were undoubtedly
    slow to the market with the release of new camera tech, Mirrorless. Sony broke
    the new market first, followed by Canon but Nikon didn't make it to market with
    Mirrorless for a few years after, by which point they were playing catch-up and
    have arguably being doing so since.\n\nAn obvious problem therefore began to grow,
    with the loss a key segment in compact cameras and their lateness to the Mirrorless
    market, Nikon's revenue and market share started to diminish yet their tech stack
    was unable to change with it. The result of markets been able to create and spend
    what they want over the last 20 years had left Nikon B.V.'s tech stack fragmented,
    decentralised and ultimately haemorrhaging money. \n\nThis is were I come in..."

  text: "## Strategy Phase\n\nMy role during the strategy phase was to work with Nikon
    to understand exactly what their current state of play is, to really get to grips
    with their landscape. \n\nTo start the phase, I decided to run a series of workshops
    for the client to take us through some of their main digital propositions where
    we could discuss pain points and frustrations and delve a bit deeper in to the
    history of why those pain point exist. The objective is to essential reverse the
    requirements gathering process so we understand current state rather than future
    state. As we progressed through the workshops I was able to begin to understand
    certain themes which we could begin to build a strategy around, which leads us
    to the next step.\n\nThat being, mapping what we have discovered so far back to
    what I would now call Strategical Pillars. \n\nThese Strategical Pillars became:\n\n*
    Cost Saving\n* Analytics & Data Quality \n* User Experience\n* Centralisation
    \n* Platform Security & GDPR\n* Revenue Opportunities  "
