  text: "## Introduction\n\nNikon, incase you haven't heard of them, are an imaging
    product company, specialising in the manufacture and development of consumer photography
    products like cameras and lenses, sport optics like binoculars and microscopy
    products. \n\nThey're one of the three biggest Imaging specialists in the world,
    that being Nikon, Sony and Canon. Nikon have been one of the biggest for the best
    part of the last 100 years since their founding in 1917. "

  text: "Over the last 2 years (2020 to 2022) I have been engaged with the European
    division on Nikon (Nikon B.V.) on an extensive Digital Transformation project.
    As an avid photography enthusiast this was such a great opportunity to work on
    a product from an industry and brand I love. \n\nLike most Digital Transformation
    projects, the scope with Nikon B.V. is huge, from E-Commerce to Automated Marketing
    and everything in-between. There is no aspect of the B.V. ecosystem I didn't touch."

  text: "## Project Background\n\nMy first interaction with Nikon B.V. started with
    running a strategy phase rather than a typical Discovery Phase. The idea being
    that Nikon knew they needed change but needed our help in first understanding
    what's gone wrong and needs to be done before we can look at any form of solution.
    \n\nTo set the scene even more, Nikon's market position over the previous 20 years
    had been slipping. During the early 2000's, Nikon were flying high dominating
    the market place with enthusiast and pro ranges and also with the compact cameras
    ranges perfect for the general consumer. So profit was high and with it was the
    autonomy of each market within Europe, markets could effectively do what they
    wanted, creating marketing sites and campaigns at will. \n\nThen, along came the
    iPhone and later other smartphones, and with every iteration, the built in cameras
    on smartphones, companion software and the rise and easily integrated social media
    platform, the compact camera slowly died out. \n\nTo add to this, Nikon were undoubtedly
    slow to the market with the release of new camera tech Mirrorless. Sony broke
    the new market first, followed by Canon but Nikon didn't make it to market with
    Mirrorless for a few years after, by which point they were playing catch-up and
    have arguably being doing so since."
