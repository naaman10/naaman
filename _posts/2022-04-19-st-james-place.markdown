    ## Introduction

    The client, St. James’s Place (SJP), is a financial services organisation with a network of 3,000+ financial advisers (partners) in the UK and Asia, each with a centrally managed website. Our mission was to migrate the existing partner network from the incumbent agency to a new tech ecosystem.

    There were many reasons the client wished to move away from their incumbent agency, including but not limited to four key pain points:

    * Cost - \~£300k per month to manage and maintain with the incumbent
    * Efficiency - Existing stack was old and inefficient meaning change was cumbersome, expensive, and the technical debt was mountainous
    * Compliance Risk - Given the cost and inefficiency of the existing stack the risk of non-compliance with FCA regulations was a growing concern, and some minor breaches had the client nervous
    * Adaptivity - The aforementioned challenges created an inert inability for SJP to respond and adapt to market changes, user needs and service requirements of partners.

    ## The Challenge

    Part of the requirements for migration was that the vast quantity of data that powered the partner websites also needed to be migrated and be available for the client-side Websites Team to manage.

    This challenge quickly became more dynamic given the following conditions. Firstly, through Discovery, we knew the client was planning a migration to, and expansion of, Salesforce from which this data could be managed. However, this was at least 5 years away so we needed to create an interim solution that both mitigated the aforementioned challenges and effectively bridged the gap to the Salesforce migration.

    Secondly, due to contractual limitations between the client and the incumbent, notice was given to the incumbent which gave us a hard cut-off date.
