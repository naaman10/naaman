    ## Introduction

    The client, St. James’s Place (SJP), is a financial services organisation with a network of 3,000+ financial advisers (partners) in the UK and Asia, each with a centrally managed website. Our mission was to migrate the existing partner network from the incumbent agency to a new tech ecosystem.

    There were many reasons the client wished to move away from their incumbent agency, including but not limited to four key pain points:

    * Cost - \~£300k per month to manage and maintain with the incumbent
    * Efficiency - Existing stack was old and inefficient meaning change was cumbersome, expensive, and the technical debt was mountainous
    * Compliance Risk - Given the cost and inefficiency of the existing stack the risk of non-compliance with FCA regulations was a growing concern, and some minor breaches had the client nervous
    * Adaptivity - The aforementioned challenges created an inert inability for SJP to respond and adapt to market changes, user needs and service requirements of partners.
