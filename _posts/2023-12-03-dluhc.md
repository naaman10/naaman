    ## Introduction

    As of January 2023, new legistaltion came in to law in the United Kingdom requiring voters to produce a form or photo ID in order to participate in elections such as Parlimentary Elections, Local Elections and Police and Crime Commissioner Elections. Due to this new legistlation, the governement provisioned a scheme to allow citizens, who do not have a conventional for of photo ID, to apply for a temporary Voter ID.

    My role as Lead Business Analyst within this project was to discover, define and build the administration portal which would allow local Electoral Registry Offices to process, approve and produce Voter ID Certificates.

    ## The Challenge

    As you can imagine, a government project which encorporates a change a law to our democratic process, touches every council and devolved nation, and every voting age citizen will present with a multitude of challenges. As mentioned this project was to discover, define and build an admin portal allowing local officals to manage Voter ID applications. The project faced some strict constaints in that the change in law had a fixed date and some planned local elections also had a fixed date, meaning our service had to be available at the time the new law came in to effect and fully operational before the local election period began.

    ## Discover

    During Discovery, my role was to work closely with our stakeholders to plan and uncover exactly what would be needed and begin designing the full end to end service, and begin to define requirements which would enable design teams to start building and testing prototypes. Our ultimate goal of Discovery was to have a Service Design and Prototype pass the GDS (Government Digital Services) Alpha Assessment.
    
    Discovery included many internal and external workshops with stakeholders, design and development teams, other government departments, integration partners. Here's some of the people we worked closely with during Discovery:
    
    **Stakeholders**
    * Electoral Registry Officers
    * DLUHC Digital Leadership
    * Cabinet Officers 
    * Electoral Commission
    
    **Internal Teams**
    * Design
    * Architecture
    * Development 
    * Leadership

    **Government Departments**
    * DLUHC
    * Home Office
    * DVLA
    * DWP
    * Cabinet Office

    **Integration Partners**
    * HM Passport Office
    * DWP - National Insurance
    * Electoral Registration Systems

    ## Define & Build

    Once we passed the GDS Alpha Assessment, we were able to begin an Agile define/design and development phase of the project. My role within this phase of work was to define the technical requirements needed to delivery on the prototype. It was my responsibility to fully understand the needs of the users admin portal, the law and capabilities of the external APIs we would need to integrate with in order to define how the portal would need to work. I worked with our internal developers to define our own APIs, making sure that strict user roles and permissions where in place in order that, at all times, our service adhered to the law. This at times was challenging as, during Discovery and Definition, the legistlation would frequently change as it was being defined and reviewed. Agile development really help us to quickly adapt and change as new legal requirements came to us. 

    In addition to API definition, I also defined the front-end requirements. Working with a team of UX/UI designers and Front-End developers, we created and easy to use experience for Electoral Registry Officers to be able to manage and process applications for Voter ID.

    ## The Result

    A data management suite that allowed the client to quickly and efficiently manage partner and regulatory data, site themes and site publications. This was part of the implementation which won the 2021 UK Dev Awards Best Deployment of a CMS.
